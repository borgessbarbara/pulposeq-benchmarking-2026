## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Readable labels for the Bambu validated count matrices.
##
## Adapted to the pulposeq output schema as of main @ c0362cb (2026-09-14).
## Both metadata tables were renamed upstream; the old column names are listed
## against the new ones in `PULPOSEQ_SCHEMA` below, and require_cols() fails
## loudly (naming the offending file) rather than silently producing all-NA
## labels, which is how the previous rename went unnoticed.
##
##   gene matrices       rownames = GENEID  (ENSG*.v or BambuGene*)
##   transcript matrices rownames = TXNAME  (ENST*.v or BambuTx*) + GENEID column
##
## Two metadata tables per dataset, both under the pipeline outdir:
##
##   ref_transcripts/annotated_transcriptome_metadata.csv
##     transcript_id_version -> transcript_name
##     gene_id_version       -> gene_name
##     plus gene_biotype / transcript_biotype
##
##   novel_transcripts/novel_transcripts_validated_metadata.csv
##     the validated novel set: one row per BambuTx, with class_code, its
##     human-readable `classification` ("multi-exon SJ match (j)"), the query
##     gene it belongs to (qry_gene_id / qry_gene_name / qry_gene_biotype),
##     the reference gene it was compared against (compared_gene_id /
##     compared_gene_name / compared_gene_biotype) and a
##     pulposeq_transcript_biotype of novel_lncRNA / novel_protein_coding /
##     novel_non_coding.
##
##     qry_gene_name and qry_gene_biotype are blank exactly for the BambuGene
##     rows (a novel gene has no reference name or biotype); for ENSG rows
##     qry_gene_id is versioned and equals compared_gene_id.
##
## Every dataset is quantified against the same reference release, so the
## versioned ID is the key throughout: no version is ever stripped.
##
## Naming rules
##   annotated feature           -> its symbol (SNHG5-225, MALAT1)
##   symbol shared by >1 feature -> SYMBOL_GENEID, not SYMBOL_1
##   gene with only novel        -> symbol from the novel table, since its ENSG
##     transcripts                  is absent from the annotated one
##   novel transcript            -> never renamed, only tagged with its class
##                                  code: BambuTx1_j
##   novel gene                  -> left exactly as it is: BambuGene9345
##
## NOTE: both metadata files are comma separated with NO row-name column, so
## read them with read.csv() and WITHOUT row.names = 1 (row.names = 1 shifts
## every column and errors on duplicate row names).
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Current column names, and the pre-2026-09 names they replaced. Kept as data
## so the error message can tell you which rename you are looking at instead of
## just reporting a missing column.
